- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to achieve responsive layouts by setting max and min values for height and width instead of absolute values. I also learned how to  add a coloured overlay to an image without adding extra mark-up. I simply put the image in a div, set the background colour of the div then adjusted the opacity of the image to make it more transparent. However I ran into an issue with the mobile view where there was a small gap between the bottom of the image and the bottom of the div.

I got rid of it by manually adjusting the height of the image at that breakpoint. If there is a better way to solve that problem please let me know.

### Continued development

I might come back and clean up the code once my skills have improved.  Hopefully I'll have the Figma files as well so I can get as close to the design as possible.
